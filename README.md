# CourseConnects: A Web App and API for College Students

CourseConnects is a web application and API designed to help college students connect with classmates and organize their coursework. With CourseConnects, you can add courses to your schedule, set your status in that course to public, private, or friends-only, search for classmates in that course and add them to your friends list, and create study sessions to work on coursework with other people in your class.

## Getting Started

To get started with CourseConnects, you will need to create an account on our website at the following Link:

Please note that the webpage can take a few minutes to load as we are hosting it on a free service with very limited resources. 
Once you have created an account, you can begin adding courses to your schedule. To add a course, simply click the "Add Course" button on your dashboard and enter the course information.
